# Is it a car, truck, or something blasphemous (like a Subaru Baja)?
## Training the model for an image classifier
 This part of an exercise from fast.ai's second lesson in which we've trained a deep learning model to classify images as a car, a truck, or a vehicle that this author believes should have never been manufactured like a Subaru Baja?
 This repo allows us to collect our data, clean our data, and build our model. 
 

## Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* voila
* fastai
* pillow
* packaging
* ipywidgets

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages.
3. Run the script.
- Code block 19 will generate a pop-up for you to manually label some data.
- Code block 20 will clean the data based on the options you selected in the pop-up window.
